# MiniMathProblems

This project contains a number of mini programs that try to solve some interesting mathematical problems.

List of mathematical problems:

1) We have a chessboard of size (2^n)x(2^n). We remove a square (x,y) from the chessboard. Divide the rest of the board in sets of squares that form an "L" shape (tromino)
