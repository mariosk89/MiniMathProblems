# MiniMathProblems

This project contains a number of mini programs that try to solve some interesting mathematical problems.

List of mathematical problems:

1) Given a grid of size (2^n)x(2^n), we remove a square (x,y) from the chessboard. 
Divide the rest of the board in sets of squares that form an "L" shape (tromino).
